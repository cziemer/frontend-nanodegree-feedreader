# Udacity Project 6 - Feed Reader Testing

**Project Description:** In this project I was given a web-based application that reads RSS feeds. The original developer of this application 
clearly saw the value in testing, they've already included [Jasmine](http://jasmine.github.io/) and even started writing their first test suite! 
Unfortunately, they decided to move on to start their own company and we're now left with an application with an incomplete test suite. That's where I come in.

To load and use:

 * Save the files (index.html, js folder and css folder) locally in the same hierarchy
 * Open index.html in your favorite browser
